# Icon Database



Just like HDLBatch, this GUI will automatically search the Game Title for the PS2 ISO you're about to Install.

the program has an Internal Database with 15853 Game Titles!

however, you can use an external database Instead.
when the program can't find the Game Title on the Database (or the Database is disabled) the name of the ISO file is assigned as the title Instead (without the extension)

If you find a Game ID that isn´t registered in our database Open a new Database Update Request
